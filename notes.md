## NOTES

This is just my personal notes for writing this guide. Here is how I use these notes:

- I write down ideas when I think of them
- When inspiration strikes and I write a section in the guide, these bullets often make it easier to complete my thoughts or round out the section


**Topics**

- remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing. Do you have a family? Children? Personal goals or a mission you want to achieve? All of the above? If you can't find the movitivation for yourself, do it for a higher purpose.
- find a reason, higher purpose or mission that transcends what you're doing today
- stay focused on the "big rocks"
- keep the "little rocks" ready to roll
- timewasters
- eliminate timewasters
- tips and tools
- law of diminishing returns
- don't multi-task: multi-tasking is a farce, and it's the antithesis of focus.
- make it personal - if you don't really enjoy what you do for a living, try to find a way to enjoy it. Spend a few hours a week learning new skills related to your profession, turn it into a hobby. Your enthusiasm will show to everyone you work with.
- write down every idea - don't ignore ideas or tell yourself you'll come back to them later. You won't. Stop what you're doing and write it down, or scaffold it out. Then write notes about what you want to accomplish, file it away. Then, when you come back to it later you'll remember what you wanted to do and you'll have a good head start.
- paralysis by analysis: don't over-analyze everything to the point where nothing at all gets done. Sometimes it's best to take intermediate action, just to make progress, so you can come back to the job later and finish what you started.
- set drop-dead dates: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by"
- pressure: When faced with external pressure to make decisions...
- avoid the "Jam Jam": https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better
- when you can't possibly accomplish everything, only do the most important things
- don't be a perfectionist
- keep moving - just pick your best available option and move on
- discard baggage - we've all had bad experiences with past decisions, collaborations, or projects. These things make you who you are, they make you wiser and should help you make better decisions in the future. But they can also prevent you from making progress if you're overly self-conscious about them. So listen to your gut, but "get over it" and keep your baggage at bay.
- glass is half-full
- set time limits
- ask for feedback or advice
- write a plan
- write an outline
- take breaks
- ignore things you can't do

## Questions

Questions to ask yourself:

- "what is causing me to procrastinate?"
- "what would make this task easier to accomplish?"
- "what are the biggest challenges I face every day?"
- "what are the biggest barriers to achieving X?"
- "if I was to achieve X, what would be possible next?"
- "what tradeoffs need to be made to accomplish X?"
- "do I know what I want to achieve?"
- "is what Iâ€™m doing getting me closer to what I want to achieve?"

- don't let indecision stop you from doing anything at all
- don't sit on your hands
- don't spin your wheels
- when you hit a roadblock with a project you're working on, switch gears
- take notes, write down your ideas as soon as you have them. 
- learn the skills and create the good habits necessary for being productive:
  * note taking
  * organizing information
  * invest time in learning tools that make you faster
  * invest time in creating tools that make you faster
