## Preamble

This brief guide was written by me, [Jon Schlinkert](#author). Currently I'm a programmer, public speaker and author of more than 1,300 code projects that collectively they receive more than [380 million downloads/month](https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002), most of which are JavaScript. I also have years of experience as an entrepreneur and business consultant. 

This guide is a distillation of my experience as a human and professional. If you find this useful (and I hope you do!), please consider following me on [github](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/jonschlinkert) to receive updates about this and other projects I maintain. If you'd like to get in touch regarding a speaking engagement or consulting opportunity, please use the email address on my GitHub profile. You can find my [bio here](../../../bio).

### What is this about?

Over the years I've found that there is no magic bullet for being productive. 

- perfectionism
- stalling
- unsure about approach, tools or how others will react
- fear of being wrong
- fear of being right
- getting overwhelmed by options, the size or scope of project or the tasks at hand
- over-complicating an otherwise simple decision

TODO

### Why should I take your word for it?

A little about me:

- I've sold a company
- I've failed a company
- I've given speeches for Congressmen
- I have many long-lasting relationships (I've been the best man in 12 weddings)

## TODO

- remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing. Do you have a family? Children? Personal goals or a mission you want to achieve? All of the above? If you can't find the movitivation for yourself, do it for a higher purpose.
- find a reason, higher purpose or mission that transcends what you're doing today
- stay focused on the "big rocks"
- keep the "little rocks" ready to roll
- timewasters
- eliminate timewasters
- tips and tools
- law of diminishing returns
- don't multi-task: multi-tasking is a farce, and it's the antithesis of focus.
- make it personal - if you don't really enjoy what you do for a living, try to find a way to enjoy it. Spend a few hours a week learning new skills related to your profession, turn it into a hobby. Your enthusiasm will show to everyone you work with.
- write down every idea - don't ignore ideas or tell yourself you'll come back to them later. You won't. Stop what you're doing and write it down, or scaffold it out. Then write notes about what you want to accomplish, file it away. Then, when you come back to it later you'll remember what you wanted to do and you'll have a good head start.   
- paralysis by analysis: don't over-analyze everything to the point where nothing at all gets done. Sometimes it's best to take intermediate action, just to make progress, so you can come back to the job later and finish what you started.
- set drop-dead dates: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by"
- channel your curiousity: Don't compromise on your curiousity, instead learn how to leverage it. Sometimes researching new and better ways of accomplishing something can contribute to procrastinating, either because it calls your current approach or decisions into question, or it opens new possibilities that you'd rather explore (which might also necessitate learning new tools or skills), or it's just a reason to be distracted. I personally think looking for better ways of accomplishing goals is of paramount importance. It's how we get better, and faster. Rather than curbing your curiousity completely, learn how to channel it. Learn how to say, "okay, I see there is a better way to do this thing I'm going. I'll try that on the next project or when I have some free time to explore. But for now, I need to stay focused."
- avoid the "Jam Jam": https://hbr.org/2006/06/more-isnt-always-better
- when you can't possibly accomplish everything, only do the most important things
- don't be a perfectionist 
- keep moving - just pick your best available option and move on
- discard baggage - we've all had bad experiences with past decisions, collaborations, or projects. These things make you who you are, they make you wiser and should help you make better decisions in the future. But they can also prevent you from making progress if you're overly self-conscious about them. So listen to your gut, but "get over it" and keep your baggage at bay.
- glass is half-full
- set time limits
- ask for feedback or advice
- write a plan
- write an outline
- take breaks
- ignore things you can't do
- avoid meetings at all cost
- avoid the energy Dementors/Wraiths in your life. people who are always negative or complaining about something (this is my personal #1)

- lists to write
  * ideas
  * todos
  * don't dos

## Inside out

> Begin channeling Stephen Covey

- don't let indecision stop you from doing anything at all
- don't sit on your hands
- don't spin your wheels
- when you hit a roadblock with a project you're working on, switch gears
- take notes, write down your ideas as soon as you have them. 
- learn the skills and create the good habits necessary for being productive:
  * note taking
  * organizing information
  * invest time in learning tools that make you faster
  * invest time in creating tools that make you faster

### Begin with the end in mind

TODO

### Put first things first

TODO

### One bite at a time

TODO

### Hack at the root

TODO

Ask yourself:

- "what is causing me to procrastinate?"
- "what would make this task easier to accomplish?"
- "what are the biggest challenges I face every day?"
- "what are the biggest barriers to achieving X?"
- "if I was to achieve X, what would be possible next?"
- "what tradeoffs need to be made to accomplish X?"
- "do I know what I want to achieve?"
- "is what I’m doing getting me closer to what I want to achieve?"

### Problems are opportunties in disguise

### Absolutely no absolutes

> Always do this, never do that!

You might have noticed that humans tend to be pretty opinionated. This seems to be particularly transparent in the programming and design worlds, given the tools and technology available to the trade, along with the myriad conventions and standards. 

It's important to stick to your proverbial guns when dealing with something that is 

Whenever possible, try not to 

- don't draw hard lines
- be flexible
- be open to suggestions
