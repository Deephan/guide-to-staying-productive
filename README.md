## Preamble

This brief guide was written by me, [Jon Schlinkert](#author). Currently I'm a programmer, public speaker and author of more than 1,300 code projects that collectively they receive more than [380 million downloads/month](https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002), most of which are JavaScript. I also have years of experience as an entrepreneur and business consultant. 

### Why should I take your word for it?

This guide is a distillation of my experience as a human and professional. If you find this useful (and I hope you do!), please consider following me on [github](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/jonschlinkert) to receive updates about this and other projects I maintain. If you'd like to get in touch regarding a speaking engagement or consulting opportunity, please use the email address on my GitHub profile. You can find my [bio here](../../../bio).

A little about me:

- I've sold a company
- I've failed a company
- I've given speeches for Congressmen
- I've been hired to turn companies around
- I have many long-lasting relationships (I've been the best man in 12 weddings)

### What is this about?

The first thing about being productive is acknowledging what "productive" really means. Staying "busy" doesn't mean you're staying productive. The word "product" is at the root of the word productive, which is a synonym for "result". That's what we're after, results.

## Inside out

TODO (Work on yourself and your habits...)

Over the years I've found that there is no silver bullet for being productive, but there are many things that prevent productivity, including:

- perfectionism
- stalling
- lack of interest
- unsure about approach, tools or how others will react
- fear of being wrong
- fear of being right
- fear of success
- fear of failure
- fear of the unknown
- getting overwhelmed by options, the size or scope of project or the tasks at hand
- over-complicating an otherwise simple decision

You'll never be at your best unless you find a way to neutralize these things, or anything else that is standing in your way. This, among other things, is what we'll discuss in this section.

### Begin with the end in mind

> Begin channeling Stephen Covey

### Dealing with distractions

- timewasters
- curiousity
- noise
- other distractions

**Channeling your curiosity**

Many productivity "experts" recommend that you get rid of this impulse. In my experience this is a bad idea. Don't compromise on your curiousity, instead learn how to leverage it. 

Sometimes researching new and better ways of accomplishing something can contribute to procrastinating, either because it calls your current approach or decisions into question, or it opens new possibilities that you'd rather explore (which might also necessitate learning new tools or skills), or it's just a reason to be distracted. I personally think looking for better ways of accomplishing goals is of paramount importance. It's how we get better, and faster. Rather than curbing your curiousity completely, learn how to channel it. Learn how to say, "okay, I see there is a better way to do this thing I'm going. I'll try that on the next project or when I have some free time to explore. But for now, I need to stay focused."

**Noise sensitivity**

### Put first things first

TODO

### One bite at a time

I like this section because it touches on two completely unrelated things that tend to cause me to lose productivity sometimes:

- going too long without eating
- procrastinating because I feel overwhelmed

In both cases, we can benefit by tackling the problem... ahem, one _bite_ at a time. (I'm sorry I couldn't help myself.)

**Feeling hungry**

For some folks, this isn't too much of a problem. But if you're hypoglycemic (like myself), it's really important to eat often enough to keep your brain functioning at an optimal state. 

TBC...

**Feeling overwhelmed**

If you're feeling overwhelmed:

- figure out how to break your task into smaller chunks. 
- ask yourself, "what would make this easier to accomplish?". Is there a tool you can build that will speed up the job? Sometimes taking one step back will thrust you ten steps forward.

### Absolutely no absolutes!

> Always do this, never do that!

You might have noticed that humans tend to be pretty opinionated. This seems to be particularly transparent in the programming and design worlds, given the tools and technology available to the trade, along with the myriad conventions and standards.
