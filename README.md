### Why should I take your word for it?

This guide is a distillation of my experience as a human and professional. We might not know each other yet, but through this guide I hope we can share a common experience that we can both relate to. From there, I hope we can take the next step and collaborate together on GitHub. 

A little about me:

- **As an entrepreneur**, I've started a few companies. One was acquired, one failed, and one is just getting started. I've also raised venture capital and angel funding multiple times.
- **As a public speaker**, I've guest lectured a number of times at several universities on the topics such as "supply chain automation", and "ebusiness and the virtual value chain", and I've given speeches for Congressmen and Fortune 500 companies about entrepreneurship and productivity.
- **As a business consultant**, I've been hired by companies to design sales, marketing, monetization and go-to-market strategies. I've been hired by Boards to turn companies around.
- **As a sales professional**, I've closed many hundreds of deals across a number of different industries, spanning from a $16m software deal to a $6m safety uniform contract. I've also managed call centers with 300 customer service reps.
- **As a software programmer**, I've authored more than 1,300 code projects that collectively they receive more than [380 million downloads/month](https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002). 
- **As a human**, I've been married for 8 years to my best friend (my wife and I were friends for 8 years before we married). We now have two beautiful girls who constantly redefine what "important" means in my life. I've also been the best man in 12 weddings. 

Regarding the last bullet, you in case you're wondering, "what does that have to do with productivity?!". That depends on how much you value "things" versus "people". To me, this means that I have learned how to be hyper-productive without compromising on the many long-lasting relationships I have with the important people in my life, which is my most important guage of success.

## Why you _shouldn't_ take my word for it

What works for me or others might not work for you. My hope is that if you share my belief that a guide like this can benefit all of us, you'll take a moment to share your experience, feedback and wisdom with us so we can improve this guide for everyone - especially others who benefit from a different viewpoint, like yours.

## What is this about?

### Goals of this guide

By the time you're finished reading this guide, you should have a better understanding of the following concepts:

- how to define success: why are we doing what we're doing? what 
knowing when "good" is good enough
- how to measure results: you can't manage what you can't measure, and you can't improve if you don't have a baseline from which to guage progress.
- how to move on: when it's time to move on to something else.

Moreover, you should be able to view these concepts through different frames of reference, referred to as "motivational lenses", within the context of different timescales.

After that, it's up to you to implement and practice these principles. 

**Defining productivity**

The first thing about being productive is understanding what "productive" really means. Staying "busy" doesn't mean you're staying productive. The word "product" is at the root of the word productive, which is a synonym for "result". That's what we're after, results. 

**Defining success**

If only it stopped with "results" we would all work fewer hours, and worry a lot less. But achieving results means much more than _plowing ahead at all cost_. If we're not achieving the "desired results", then we're just wasting time. Thus it's important for us to always try to measure our productivity against how we'll we're achieving the "desired results" in whatever task, project, role, mission or area of responsibility is pertinent at the time. 

**Defining a beginning, middle and end**

If red flags are going off, and you're not even sure what the "desired results" should be for whatever you're working on, have no fear, we're going to cover this and more in the following sections. For now, let's take a step back and start at the beginning.


TODO 

Address the following concepts

- [ ] Work on yourself and your habits...
- [ ] Overcome obstacles and eliminate distractions 
- [ ] Learn how to research and organize your ideas


## Inside out

**Productivity prevention**

Over the years I've found that there is no silver bullet for being productive, but there are many things that prevent productivity, including:

- perfectionism
- stalling
- lack of interest
- unsure about approach, tools or how others will react
- fear of being wrong
- fear of being right
- fear of success
- fear of failure
- fear of the unknown
- getting overwhelmed by options, the size or scope of project or the tasks at hand
- over-complicating an otherwise simple decision

You'll never be at your best unless you find a way to neutralize these things, or anything else that is standing in your way. This, among other things, is what we'll discuss in this section.

### Motivational lenses

Why we're doing what we doing...

**Perspectives**

Frames-of-reference:

- the forest: The "big picture", viewed through the lens of the most important, long-term goals in your life. These things would likely go in the _self-actualization_ of [Maslow's hierchy of needs][maslow].   
- the trees: The near-tearm projects that we're responsible for accomplishing at work or home. Someone is expecting us to complete
- the weeds: the pressing, in-the-moment tasks that need to be accomplished before you call it a day.

**Timespans**



### Putting first things first

TODO

### Dealing with distractions

- timewasters
- curiousity
- noise
- other distractions

**Channeling your curiosity**

Many productivity "experts" recommend that you get rid of this impulse. In my experience this is a bad idea. Don't compromise on your curiousity, instead learn how to leverage it. 

Sometimes researching new and better ways of accomplishing something can contribute to procrastinating, either because it calls your current approach or decisions into question, or it opens new possibilities that you'd rather explore (which might also necessitate learning new tools or skills), or it's just a reason to be distracted. I personally think looking for better ways of accomplishing goals is of paramount importance. It's how we get better, and faster. 

Rather than curbing your curiousity completely, learn how to channel it. Learn how to say, "okay, I see there is a better way to do this thing I'm doing. I'll try that on the next project or when I have some free time to explore. But for now, I need to stay focused." 

**Noise sensitivity**

TODO...

### One bite at a time

I like this section because it touches on two completely unrelated things that tend to cause me to lose productivity sometimes:

- going too long without eating
- procrastinating because I feel overwhelmed

In both cases, we can benefit by tackling the problem... ahem, one _bite_ at a time. (I'm sorry I couldn't help myself.)

**Feeling hungry**

For some folks, this isn't too much of a problem. But if you're hypoglycemic (like myself), it's really important to eat often enough to keep your brain functioning at an optimal state. 

TBC...

**Feeling overwhelmed**

If you're feeling overwhelmed:

- figure out how to break your task into smaller chunks. 
- ask yourself, "what would make this easier to accomplish?". Is there a tool you can build that will speed up the job? Sometimes taking one step back will thrust you ten steps forward.

### Absolutely no absolutes!

> Always do this, never do that!

You might have noticed that humans tend to be pretty opinionated. This seems to be particularly transparent in the programming and design worlds, given the tools and technology available to the trade, along with the myriad conventions and standards.
